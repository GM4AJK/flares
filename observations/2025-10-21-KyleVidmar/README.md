Time Unknown/not specified

This one remained unidentied with some notable perculararities.

1. The astrometry appear to indicate that from his obs location and the guessed date/time his camera was rolled over by approx 130 degrees.
2. For 2025-10-20 and 2025-10-20 no match was made.

It's possible he posted an old video without any data. Leaving at that as I'm not going to ask.
